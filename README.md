# üõ°Ô∏è Safe Zone - Wearable Tracking System for Alzheimer's Patients

Safe Zone is a smart wearable project designed to improve the safety and independence of individuals suffering from Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. It provides real-time GPS tracking, geofencing alerts, and SOS functionalities ‚Äî all integrated into a tamper-resistant smartwatch. This project was developed as part of the *Joy of Engineering* course at **BML Munjal University**.



## üìå Problem Statement

Patients with Alzheimer‚Äôs often suffer from memory loss, disorientation, and wandering, placing them at significant risk. Existing solutions are either too expensive, easy to remove, or require constant connectivity. **Safe Zone** addresses these gaps by offering an affordable, wearable, and secure device that ensures constant tracking and caregiver alerting.
